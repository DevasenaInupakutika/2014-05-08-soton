<h3>Overview</h3>

    <h4>Editor</h4>
    <p>
      When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text
      editor that is optimized for writing code, with features
      like automatic color-coding of key words.
      The default text editor on Mac OS X and Linux is usually set to Vim,
      which is not famous for being intuitive.
      if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it,
      try typing the escape key,
      followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q', exclamation mark),
      then hitting Return
      to return to the shell.
    </p>
    <h4>The Bash Shell</h4>
    <p>
      Bash is a commonly-used shell. Using a shell gives you
      more power to do more tasks more quickly with your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h4>Git</h4>
    <p>
      Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It
      lets you track who made changes to what when and has
      options for easily updating a shared or public version of
      your code on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    </p>

  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>
      Python is becoming very popular in scientific computing,
      and it's a great language for teaching general programming concepts due to its easy-to-read syntax.
      We teach with Python version 2.7,
      since it is still the most widely used.
      Installing all the scientific packages for Python individually can be a bit difficult,
      so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
    </p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p>
      R is a programming language that specializes in statistical
      computing. It is a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis. To
      interact with R, we will
      use <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive
      development environment (IDE).
    </p>
    <h4>SQL</h4>
    <p>
      SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.
      We use a simple database manager called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>,
      either directly or through a browser plugin.

    <h4>Virtual Machine</h4>
    <p>
      Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
      rather than install software on their own computers.
      If your instructors have chosen to do this,
      please:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Download our <a href="{{site.vm_url}}">VM image</a>.
	<strong>Warning:</strong>
	this file is 1.7 GByte,
	so please download it <em>before</em> coming to your bootcamp.
      </li>
      <li>
	Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance"
	and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
      </li>
    </ol>
