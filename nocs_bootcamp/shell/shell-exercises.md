##Shell Exercises

###Commands

The following are some shell commands.  Try each one out with a filename argument.  Then try to figure out (use ``man'' or the internet) how to add the suggested option.  

* cat / less
* head / tail

How do you change the default number of lines printed?  

* grep

This command requires one extra command besides a filename.  

* sort

How do you reverse the order of a sort?  Or sort "numerically"  If you have extra time, how do you sort by the 2nd column in a .csv file?  

* wc 

How do you print only the number of lines in a file?  How about words?  Characters?  

* cut

How do you extract the 2nd column of a .csv file?  

###Pipes
